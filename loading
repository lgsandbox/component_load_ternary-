      {user?.loading ? (<Loading/>) : (user?.issuer && (
          <>
          <VStack>
            <div>Email</div>
            <div className='profile-info'>{user.email}</div>
            <div>User Id</div>
            <div>{user.issuer}</div>
            </VStack>
          </>
        ))}
      
      
      Saving this implementation, worked well with context (user?) magic link auth api
      
      going to check if it works without context (loading is callback of magic here?)
      
      will post results later and reuse, very handy way of rendering conditional loading components
      
      even if custom loading state is needed
